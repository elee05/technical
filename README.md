Living in Boston, a city with what feels like very erratic sunrise and sunset times, I have always been interested in sunrise and sunset times across the world.This is a full-stack web app using React, NodeJS, and MongoDB that allows the user to easily view sunrise and sunset times anywhere across the world, and tell them about places in totally different parts of the world with similar times.

Features:
- An interactive, pretty world map that spans most of the home page, using the React Leaflet library.
= An event that places a marker at your current location with a popup that displays the sunrise and sunset times of your location using the Sunrise Sunset JS library.
- The popup also displays information about a place in a totally different part of the world with similar sunrise and sunset times using Google Gemini API
